# bash-scripts
just a list of useful bash scripts for my own purposes
- [obsidian-auto-commit](https://github.com/epic-dev/bash-scripts/blob/master/obsidian-notes-auto-commit.sh) is used weekly for commiting my notes from Obsidian. I don't care about conflicts in notes I believe this is a rare case. It has prefix `auto-` it means that this script is executed automatically by macOS.
